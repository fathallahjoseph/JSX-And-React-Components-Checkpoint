Checkpoint Objective
In this checkpoint, we are going to use what we have learned so far to play around with some React components and JSX.

Instructions
Create a project using create-react-app.
Create App.js file in src folder and use it as a root component for your React app.
Create a profile folder (path: src/Component/Profile).
Inside your profile folder, create: (ProfilePhoto.js / FullName.js / Address.js ).
ProfilePhoto.js: a functional component that returns a photo of your profile.
FullName.js: a functional component that returns your full name.
Address.js:  a functional component that returns your address.
Import profile components into App.js and use them.
Feel free to style your app as you wish.
